# PlusRateMonitorDevice

# Introduction
     • Develop medical equipment 
     • Using built in libraries (liquid crystal, heart rate) of IDE and some major component Arduino, sensor and C++.
     • Functionalities to check heart rate.

# Component:
    
     • Arduino uno
     • PulseSensor max30100
     • Jumper wire
     • Breadboard
     • Resistor 10kohm
     • LCD 16 x 2

# Methodolgy
     
    • First of All,  Program is loaded in Arduino to read the signal from sensors.
    • Connection of Pins is also defined in this Program.
    • We will read data from serial port through default Libraries of IDE.

# Input/output of Circuit
    
    • Trigger is the input pin of Sensor which can be used to initialize measurement by transmitting pulse waves
    • Whenever we place our finger over the  sensor, Some output can be observed on LCD.
    
# Applications

    • Suspected heart attack (myocardial infraction).
    • Presence of seizures.
    • Monitoring of known cardiac arrhythmias.
    • Medical monitoring when some kind of anesthesia is involved.
    • Continuous or long-term monitoring could be done by Holter monitor
